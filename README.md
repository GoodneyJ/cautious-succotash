# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Purpose of  Project

Just wanted to try my hand at recreating a design by eye and seeing how close I could get to the original thing.
Not really sure if I want to continue doing the rest of the site, don't think I will. I kinda wanna just get started on another maybe even make my own to better my eye for design..

## Where I got the design

I got the design from: https://w3layouts.com/ front page,

Can be purchased from: https://w3layouts.com/template/car-servicing-website-template/

It was designed by: https://roverthemes.com/ so shout out to them, hopefully they don't get mad I did this

## Stuff I Used

React(duh)

React-Icons: https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/
Lets you implement only icons you use in your project from a bunch of different sources(font awesome, devicons, game icons, etc...) rather than downloading a whole icon package

an Owl-Carousel Component: https://github.com/laurenchen0631/react-owl-carousel
I was gonna try bootstrap but i figured I'd try to get the original plugin they used for the WP design
which was Owl Carousel (https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/). When that didn't work I found the component by lauren chen(linked above) so thanks to her for making that. Was the first time I tried downloading a custom component like that and using it.

## Stuff to add

-- I still need to add:
    Responsive/Mobile view screen sizes,
    Proper color hover effects for social icons in footer,
    light/dark mode toggle switch,
    proper dropdown menu for the nav,
    back to top button,
